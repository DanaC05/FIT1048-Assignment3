|   You are in the midst of the end of the world. An outbreak of a     |
|   mutated fungus has spread, causing anyone who comes into contact   |
|   with it to transform into what is now known as 'the infected'.     |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   You are miraculously immune and need to find your way to the       |
|   medical experts part of the rebel group that call themselves the   |
|   'Fireflies' so a possible vaccine can be developed. You have been  |
|   travelling with another survivor named Joel, who has been tasked   |
|   with escorting you to the Fireflies medical facility.              |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   Joel has been critically injured after you were both ambushed      |
|   trying to find the Fireflies at the university of Eastern          |
|   Colorado. You managed to escape with Joel, finding shelter in an   |
|   abandoned house.                                                   |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   Without any medical supplies, Joel is certain to succumb to his    |
|   injuries. You know of a nearby bandit commune that is bound to     |
|   have what he needs. You have scouted the hideout and found that    |
|   the medical supplies are kept in the office with a keypad lock     |
|   on the second floor of their main building.                        |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   The only problem: you dont know the combination.                   |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   You know you will only have a small window to crack the code and   |
|   obtain the antibiotics Joel desperately needs. You've studied the  |
|   patrol routine and have estimated that you will only have a        |
|   certain number of attempts at the keycode before guards will       |
|   check the office.                                                  |
|                                                                      |
|                                                                      |
|   Will you be able to get the supplies and save Joel's life?         |
|                                                                      |
